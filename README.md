# My-Mondrian-Art

## Description

This project is a digital recreation of Mondrian art, a style characterized by geometric shapes, bold colors, and grid-based layouts. Inspired by the work of Piet Mondrian, this artwork uses modern web technologies to create a visually striking piece that blends art and code.

The project utilizes HTML and CSS to define a grid-based layout filled with various colored blocks, each carefully positioned to reflect the abstract geometric style of Mondrian. The design is fully responsive, ensuring the artwork maintains its composition across different screen sizes.

## How It Works

- **Grid Layout**: The layout is created using CSS Grid, dividing the canvas into specific rows and columns. Each grid item represents a colored block within the composition.
- **Colors and Blocks**: The CSS file (`style.css`) contains classes that define the colors and positioning of each block. The colors are chosen to match the primary hues often found in Mondrian's works.
- **Responsive Design**: The CSS is crafted to ensure the artwork looks consistent on various devices, maintaining the integrity of the geometric design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser to view the project.
- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS if you wish to modify the artwork.

### How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the Mondrian-inspired artwork.
3. Explore and enjoy the visual experience, or customize the CSS to create your own version of Mondrian art.

### Customization

If you want to create your own version of the artwork:
- **Edit Colors**: Modify the background colors of the grid items by changing the CSS classes in the `style.css` file.
- **Change Layout**: Adjust the grid layout by editing the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties in the CSS.
- **Add/Remove Blocks**: Add or remove grid items in the HTML file to experiment with different compositions.
